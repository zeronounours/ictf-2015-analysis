# iCTF 2015 Analysis

This repository provides an analysis of some (in a perfect world, all) services
involved during the 2015 session of the [UCSB iCTF][ictf], code name 
**Crowdsourcing Evil**.

As most of the analyses may refer to the code of the service, you may want to
get a copy of the service. You can download the VMs on the [archive][archive]
page of the iCTF website.


## Repository layout

Each service has its own subdirectory in `analyses`, with related files in it.
It always includes the service analysis, but it may also include proof of
concept code asssociated with the exploit method.
